EMAILJS TEMPLATE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Go to your EmailJS Dashboard > Email Templates > Create New Template.

2. In the "Subject" field, paste this:
   {{subject}}

3. In the "Content / Body" field, delete everything there and paste ONLY this line:
   {{{message}}}

   (Note: You MUST use 3 curly braces {{{ }}} so the HTML design renders correctly.)

4. Save the Template.

---------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS:
Our application generates the full email content (with the blue header, table of details, Class Name, Date, Time, etc.) automatically in the code.

By using {{{message}}}, you are telling EmailJS to just display the beautiful email we designed, filling in all the details dynamically.

You do NOT need to manually type "Class: {{class_name}}" in EmailJS. The code handles it all for a professional look.
